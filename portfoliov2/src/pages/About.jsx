                    I am a developer from San Antonio, Texas. I enjoy all things tech
                    hardware and software. My goal is to find and inject efficiency in the
                    world of technology to benefit people in their quest to solve real
                    world problems. The ability to innovate and pioneer bigger and better
                    is a dream I continue to pursue.
